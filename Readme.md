# Basic control loop for a CombinedHW robot

This is a generic, but basic, control loop for ros_control. It allows to load several hardware interfaces, for any composed robot, like our [Omnigrasper][] (Youbot base and Dynamixel-based arm).

This software is not finished and is developed as part as our efforts on having all our robots work with ros_control.

## Features

- support for combined hardware interface or combined RobotHW (depends who you ask)
- very small

## Support and contact

This software is developed as part of the ResiBots project. We do our best to keep it free of bug and to implement relevant features. Should you face an issue or have a suggestion, please open an issue.
